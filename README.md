# Web of Inventions: Project #2
## Project Description
The App Iâ€™ll be building will be called The World Of Inventions . With this app, the user will be able to search by name of inventor or name of invention. The search will be based upon key-words so once the user enters in what they are seeking, the user will be taken to the results page where all relevant data will appear. The user can scroll through and view article titles. Once they click on the article clipping the inventor/ invention info will appear to read about.

## Wireframes & React Component Hierarchy
***TBD
- [wireframes]()
- [react architecture]()

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.


#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Client is presented a functional application
- The application utilizes an Api.
- The Api data rendering is functional.
- When utilizing the app, the client can request Api data.
- Render Api data on page. 
- Allow user to utilize basic functionality

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- On furthering with Mvp goals I would like to add a filtered section to add a material search and date search. Let's say I wanted to look up to see if there are any patients/inventions with this material. The client can type that into the material search box, they will then be taken to the results page which would display relevant data. This app would really help nerdy people like me that love inventions, but would also help people that are looking to create a patient but need to be sure it hasn't already been created

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
