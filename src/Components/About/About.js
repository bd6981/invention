<h2>PatentsView is an award-winning visualization, data dissemination, and analysis platform that focuses on intellectual property (IP) data. Support for the site and the team that works on it comes from the Office of the Chief Economist at the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). PatentsView serves students, educators, researchers, policymakers, small business owners, and the public. It offers a unique and valuable open data platform providing free data dissemination and value-added analyses to foster better knowledge of the IP system and drive new insights into invention and innovation. 

PatentsView began in 2012 as a team project with the USPTO, American Institutes for Research (AIR), University of Massachusetts Amherst, New York University, University of California, Berkeley, Twin Arch Technologies, and Periscopic. The beta version was released to the public in December 2015, and the full website was launched in January 2017. PatentsViewâ€™s user community is growing over time. In 2019, the platform attracted an average of more than 77,000 Application Program Interface (API) queries per day, 167 hits per day to the visualization and search interfaces, and a substantial number of direct data set downloads. 

Since its inception, the collaborators have developed and deployed several web-based tools and databases. These products include:
